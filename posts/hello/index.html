<p>I used to have a blog when I was a teenager, and I recently caught myself missing the feeling of sharing my thoughts with the void of the internet. Twitter served this purpose for a while, but have you seen twitter lately? It is sad to watch... also, I've heard we're supposed to call it X now. But more than the death of twitter, the slow and ongoing death of my academic life was a big motivator to start this blog.
Moreover, sometimes I just need something to tinker with and this seemed like a nice little project to set up.</p>
<p>My plan is to post about data science and AI trends. Now let's see if I can keep this thing up.</p>
